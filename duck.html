		<h1>Ducks</h1>

		<p>Ducks, also called waterfowl, are a category of bird. Ducks are traditionally divided among three subfamilies: the monotypic surface-feeders, the sea ducks and the freshwater ducks. Although they have many different characteristics, one trait all ducks share is that they dive for their food. Ducks are highly adapted to living in the water. They have webbed feet and their feathers are oily, which gives them waterproofing and helps keep them warm. Ducks are found all over the world, and there are dozens of different species.</p>

		<p>Ducks are social animals and live in small groups or large flocks. Ducks are very protective of their young and will even attack predators if they feel their offspring are in danger. Male ducks are called drakes and the females are called hens. Both drakes and hens have a bill that is broad and flat. Their diet consists mostly of plants, but they will also eat small insects, fish and other small animals.</p>
